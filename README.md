# MultiWindowAngular

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

This will host your angular application. To launch the demo controller (which will launch the angular app on OpenFin).

```
npm i -g http-server
npm i -g openfin-cli
http-server openfin-service -c-1
openfin -l -c app.json
```

All of this can be done not from the command line via node modules but this is a demo. If you require assistance with this please create an issue.
